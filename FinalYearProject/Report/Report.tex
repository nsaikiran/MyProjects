\chapter*{Abstract}

\par Information Extraction (IE) distills structured data or knowledge from 
un-structured text by identifying references to named entities as well as stated relationships between such entities.
The structured data with relevant information can be queried for required information.
%IE technologies can be used to document summarization.
In the process of information extraction for BBC news data set\footnote{Click on \texttt{>> Download raw text files} of \texttt{Dataset: BBC} of \url{http://mlg.ucd.ie/datasets/bbc.html}\\Or \url{http://mlg.ucd.ie/files/datasets/bbc-fulltext.zip}},
 we recognized four named entity
 classes (PERSON, ORGANIZATION, Global Position Entity(GPE) and LOCATION) in the data
 and extracted relations between considered named entities using hand-written rules with regular expressions. 
 The yield of this system we built is the knowledge extracted from the given natural language text.
 All the source code and documentation are hosted on github\footnote{\url{https://github.com/saikiran638/MyProjects/tree/master/FinalYearProject}}
 

%\par Information Extraction is the task of extracting structured data out of unstructured
 %data like natural language text as the structured data can be easily processed by a computing
%  machine. So when we have unstructured data, we extract relevant information in structured form
%   like tables and then use some queries to get required information.
% To extract information, named entities are recognized and relation between considered named
% entities are extracted.
%Here we recognized four classes of named entities (PERSON, ORGANIZATION,
%Global Position Entity(GPE), LOCATION) and extracted relations using hand-written rules (with regular expressions).

\chapter{Introduction}
\par When we have large amount of (previous)data we might want to extract some useful information
 out of it, and use it as summary or we can predict the future events by learning from the
 data at hand.
\par Most of the time data that is available for use in un-structured form like Natural Language Text
rather than structured form like tables. It is easy to extract required information or 
answer a question if the data we are working on has structured form.But it is difficult to handle unstructured data. Because Natural Language Processing(NLP)
that works on unstructured data is still developing.
\par The amount of natural language text that is available in electronic 
form is truly staggering, and is increasing every day. 
However, 
the complexity of natural language can make it very difficult to access the information in that text\cite{BookIE}.
\par If we instead focus our efforts on a limited set of questions or 
"entity relations," such as "where are different facilities located,
" or "who is employed by what company," we can make significant progress.\cite{BookIE}
\par Here we are trying to understand the given text and find the limited relevant parts of it.
 This is what the researchers called as \textbf{Information Extraction}. There are two
  subtasks in infomation extraction those are \texttt{Named Entity Recognition} and \texttt{Relation Extraction}. We work on both of them now.
\section{Aim}
\par Our aim is to identify named entities and working out the relationship between them using hand-written
 rules with regular expressions. We may use this system for question \& answering. For most of the questions often the answers be named entities.
The below image \ref{IE} will give an intuition of what we are going to do. That is the procedure followed. 
\par For relevant, meaningful relation detection we use some regular expressions on that tuples.
To host this project on \texttt{github}\footnote{This project with its source code and documentation available at: \url{https://github.com/saikiran638/MyProjects/tree/master/FinalYearProject}} for ease of access and modification.

\section{Technologies Used}
Language of choice is Python as it eases development with high-level data structures and modules built-in. Most important modules we used are :
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{nltk} (Natural Language Tool Kit module)
\par We used Python's  Natural Language Tool Kit for implementation. It has good documentation and tutorials\footnote{\url{http://www.nltk.org/book}}.
It allows convenient access\footnote{\url{http://www.nltk.org/howto}} of corpus in different languages, and has many natural language processing
 methods implemented for better performance. We can use them for better results.
\item \texttt{re} (Regural Expression module)
\par Provides convenient methods to write and test regular expressions. We used it to write rules while extracting relations.
\end{itemize}
\chapter{Named Entity Recognition}
\section{Introduction}
\par \textbf{Named Entity Recognition} is an important sub task of Information Extraction, 
in this we are going to find and classify (into different classes like PERSON,ORGANIZATION and LOCATION etc.) 
 the concrete names.
\par We are interested in \textit{Named} Entity Recognition. Because not all entities are 
attached with a name (specific).
For the literature survey on named entity recognition, please refer\cite{Rahul}.
\section{Named Entity Recognition as Tagging}
\par \textit{Bikel et. al}\footnote{\url{http://ilk.uvt.nl/~toine/research/bikel-1999.pdf}} mapped the  Named the Entity Recognition problem very directly into tagging problem. 
Tagging problem is to determine a tag to a particular word in the given text. Tagging problem requires
 a set of tags and considerable amount of tagged corpus with the same set of tags. Bikel et. al considered nearly seven name classes and a  
 NOT-A-NAME tag as set of tags.
 

\begin{figure}[htp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=3in,width=5in]{bikel.png}
\caption{Stage Diagram of NER as Tagging by Bikel et. al}
\label{NERasT}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}[htp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=3.5in,width=6.5in]{nerastagging.png}
\caption{NER as tagging}
\label{NERasT2}
\end{figure}

They have come up with a Hidden Markov Model\cite{hmm} based tagger(which is an example of generative model of learning\footnote{ For clear understanding please refer Abstract and Introduction of \cite{Ng}})
 to tag the given text with named entity tags. 
 They used hand-tagged corpus to train their model(Hidden Markov Model) and considered some
 word-features to deal with low-frequency words. Figure \ref{NERasT} gives an idea of their work, it
  is the state diagram of the model they proposed. The model assigns a tag(state) to current word, and next word has different probabilities
   to be assigned with different tags. The next word will be given a tag that has maximum
    probability to be assigned.
These probabilities will be the parameters of 
   the model which are learned\cite{Videos} from the tagged corpus .
 \par Figure \ref{NERasT2} gives a better intuition of named entity recognition as tagging. According to this example
   multi-word names can be easily identified and grouped. No entity(NA) tag is equivalent to  NOT-A-NAME tag. 
\par The major problem with named entity recognition as tagging is that  we need huge 
 amount of hand-labeled corpus, with named entity classes as labels. This corpus can't be 
 used for another purpose. But the another approach to NER, which consists of part-of-speech
  tagging and chunking requires part-of-speech tagged corpus which can used for many other
   purposes like machine translation.
\par There are many advanced ways to solve the tagging problem some of them are Maximum
Entropy Markov Models, Perceptron taggers etc. \\To know about these other methods, please refer \footnote{For more details: Tagging Problems, and Hidden Markov Models of \cite{mc} and POS Tagging of \cite{SNLP}}\\
\vspace{2in}

\pagebreak
\section{Named Entity Recognition with PoS tagging \& Chunking}
\par Now we have lot of part of speech tagged corpora (especially for english) as we can
 use it for machine translataion and many other applications. Here we are going to use 
 PoS tagging for NER. \par After having natural language senetences with their underlying \textit{
 tag sequences} we group the tags into named entities.

\subsection{PoS Tagging}
\par Part of speech tagging\footnote{For more details: Tagging Problems, and Hidden Markov Models of \cite{mc} and POS Tagging of \cite{SNLP}} problem is to determine the parts of speech of a particular
instance of word. The intuition of PoS tagging is presented in below image \ref{pos}\footnote{Slide from
 The Tagging Problem of \cite{mc}}.
\par Tags may vary depending on corpus we are dealing with. For example, tag set of The Brown Corpus\footnote{\url{https://www.comp.leeds.ac.uk/ccalas/tagsets/brown.html}} and P.O.S tag set of The Penn Treebank\footnote{\url{https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html}}.
To check in NLTK, execute and \textit{nltk.help.brown\_tagset()},\textit{nltk.help.upenn\_tagset()} respectively for the brown corpus tagset and Penn Treebank tagset.
\par If we want to write a tagger then we need \textit{large amount of labled corpus}\footnote{For more insights of 
Machine Learning techniques I feel, \cite{Videos} is a good source}. Which in this case
 are Penn Tree Bank tagged corpus or Brown corpus.
For more insights on writing a parts of speech tagger in NLTK, please refer\cite{tag}
\par For theoritical understanding of a tagger. We learned how a Hidden Markov Model tagger\cite{hmm}
 works. Here for this problem we used NLTK's default implementation of tagger(\textit{
 nltk.tag()}) as it is recommeneded for better results.

\begin{figure}[htp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=3in,width=5.5in]{postag.png}
\caption{Part-of-Speech Tagging}
\label{pos}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Named Entity Chunking}
\par After tagging comes the named entity chunking\footnote{For more details: refer \cite{BookIE}}. We'll group the pos tags into named
 entities (if possible intuit its class). Chunker is also a tagger that is trained on some
  corpus.
One of the most useful sources of information for NP-chunking(Noun Phrase-chunking) is part-of-speech tags.
This is one of the motivations for performing part-of-speech tagging in our information extraction system
\par Here for this problem we used NLTK's default implementation of named entity chunker
(\textit{nltk.ne\_chunk()}) as it is recommended for better results. It can be used for multi-
class(PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANIZATION and GPE) or binary class(NP).

\begin{figure}[htp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=1in,width=5in]{chunk1.png}
\caption{Chunking}
\label{Chunk}
\end{figure}

\par For more insights on develping a chunker, please refer \cite{BookIE}. Here it described
 how to create a basic chunker and a chunker that can learn from data for good performance.
\par Morphology of words to identify Noun Phrases. And to identify the class of Noun Phrase(Named Entity) the chunker will use context of the Noun Phrase.
There are many formats to represent Named Entities, those are IB(Every token is \textbf{I}n the chunk or \textbf{B}egining of the chunk), IOB(Every token is \textbf{I}n the chunk or \textbf{O}ut of the chunk or \textbf{B}egining of the Chunk),tree representation etc.

\chapter{Relation Extraction}
\par Relation Extraction is an important component of Information Extraction.
Using the Named Entities and clever patterns we extract relation. These rules can 
get high precision as they are specific.
\par We will focus on the simpler task of extracting \textbf{relation triples}. Relation
triples are of the form \texttt{(Named Entity,Relation,Named Entity)}.
We use patterns to find whether \texttt{Relation} between those \texttt{Named Entities}
 is meaningful and relavent. Procedure is clearly explaned in \ref{proc}
\par We will use \texttt{relextract} module of \texttt{Python's NLTK} for this.
 This is rule based relation extraction because we are using hand-written rules.
We can create new structured knowledge bases by relation extraction.
Questions that are asked in natural language can be converted in to a query to a structured
knowledge base.
\par So, Here is a question for us. \textit{Which relations should we extract ?} It depends
on how many \textbf{classes of entities} we are able to extract in \textit{Named Entity Recognition}.
And here we extracted four classes of names. A set of relations  comes from the \textit{Automated Content Extraction (ACE)} task.

\caption{Relation between PERSON and ORGANIZATION named entity classes}
\label{IE2}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{ACE}\footnote{Slide from: \url{https://class.coursera.org/nlp/lecture/138}}
 shows ACE relations.
Figure \ref{IE2}\footnote{\url{https://class.coursera.org/nlp/lecture/139}} gives basic intuition of relation between entities.

\section{How to extract relations ?}
We can use:
\begin{itemize}
\item Hand-written patterns
\item Supervised,semi-supervised and unsupervised machine learning
\end{itemize}
We are using \textit{only} Hand-written patterns to extract relations as it is simplest
way. Here we are trying to \texttt{extract relations}\footnote{For more information on relation extraction, please refer Week 4 - Relation Extraction of \cite{SNLP}} between \textit{specific entities}.
\par We used \textbf{regular expressions } \cite{re} in Python to write patterns to extract relations.

\subsection[procedure]{Procedure followed}\label{proc}

\begin{itemize}
\item First identify the named entities (POS tagging then Chunking).
\item Then we group a Noun phrase with its left context.\\ Now we'll have document as list of tuples.\\
Ex: \texttt{[(String1,Named Entity1), (String2,Named Entity2) , (String3,Named Entity3) , ... ]}\\
Here \texttt{Named Entity1,Named Entity2,Named Entity3} are tree representations of Noun Phrase.
Now we take two consecutive tuples and add them to create \textit{semi}relation dictionaries.\\
That dictionary contains \textbf{key},\textbf{value} as described in table \ref{table}
	\begin{table}[h]
	\centering
    \begin{tabular}{ | p{5cm} | p{5cm} |}
    \hline
    \textbf{KEY} & \textbf{VALUE} \\\hline
    \texttt{filler}(text between two Named Entities) &  \texttt{String2} which is leftcontext of Named Entity2\\ \hline
    \texttt{lcon}(left context of the relation) & \texttt{String1} which is leftcontext of Named Entity1.  \\\hline
    \texttt{objclass}(Class of object of the relation) & \texttt{Root of the Named Entity2 tree structure}\\\hline
    \texttt{objsym}(Normalized text of object with no white space & \texttt{Normalized object with underscore in palce of space.}\\\hline
    \texttt{objtext} & \texttt{objtext}\\\hline
    \texttt{rcon}(right context of the relation) & \texttt{String3}, which is right context of the Named Entity 2\\\hline
    \texttt{subjclass}(Class of subject of the relation) & \texttt{Root of the Named Entity1 tree structure.}\\\hline
    \texttt{subjsym}(Normalized text of suject with no white space) & \texttt{Normalized subject with underscore in palce of space.}\\\hline
    \texttt{subjtext} & \texttt{subject text}\\\hline
    \texttt{untagged\_filler} & \texttt{filler with no POS tags}\\\hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Explanation of Key,Value pairs of \texttt{semi}relation dictionary}
    \label{table}
    \end{table}
\item Apply hand-written rules on filler,right context and left context to extract relations
\end{itemize}
\par For more information on relation extraction, please refer \cite{BookIE} for more information.
The rules we wrote for this project can be found here\footnote{\url{https://github.com/saikiran638/MyProjects/blob/master/FinalYearProject/RelationRules.py}}
\subsection{Positives of Hand-written rules}
\begin{itemize}
\item String patterns tends to be  high-precision.
\item Works well for specific domains/entities.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Negatives of Handiwritten rules}
\begin{itemize}
\item It's difficult to think of all possible patterns.
\item We don't want to fix the entities for relation extraction.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Observations and Results}
\section{Observations}
\par Named Entity Chunker provided in Python's NLTK (\textit{nltk.ne\_chunk}) considers morphology of 
words while chunking. Make sure that words are not normalized(HMMTagger requires words to 
be normalized) while chunking.
\par Trained HMMTagger(for PoS tagging) available in Python's NLTK with \textit{treebank} tagged corpus and
 tried chunking but performance is not as good as NLTK's Recommended PoS tagger (\textit{nltk.tag}).
 So, we used NLTK's Recommended PoS tagger for tagging sentences. It was found that NLTK's
  current recommended tagger is 'Averaged Perceptron Tagger'(It might change over time).

\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}
\section{Conclusion}
\par We extracted named entities and relations associated with them in BBC news data sets.

The data we are going to use should be a formal writing.
 For informal writings it won't work well as every steps assumes the formal nature
  of the text.
 More importantly the total performance this system directly depends on the performance \texttt{taggers}
  we are using
  for parts of speech tagging and \texttt{chunkers} noun phrase chunking.It is better to take taggers those
   performs well.


\section{Future Work}
\par Indian languages have very less \textit{tagged} corpus\footnote{2.2 Reading Tagged Corpora of \cite{tag} and \url{http://www.nltk.org/howto/corpus.html}} compared to English. We require
large amount of \textit{tagged corpus} to train taggers.
\begin{itemize}
\item To recognize named entities in Indian languages
\item To apply Information Extraction for Indian languages.
\end{itemize}
